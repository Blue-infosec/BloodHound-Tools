# What is DBCreator?
This is a script, based on SpecterOps [DBCreator](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound-Tools/blob/master/DBCreator/DBCreator.py).
The goal of this script is to simulate network access between computer nodes in the generated database.

Besides creating nodes and edges for BloodHound, it can also receive an average number of hosts, that each host will have access to. 
Each host is have an additional "Open" edges between other hosts it has access to.
